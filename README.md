All API calls are made respectfully with appropriate rate limiting and error handling.

   - Make sure Git is installed and accessible at `C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe`
   
2. **"ani-cli may not be properly installed" warning**:
   - Make sure ani-cli is installed in your Git Bash environment
   - Test by running `ani-cli --version` in Git Bash

3. **Search not working**:
   - Check your internet connection
   - APIs may be temporarily unavailable, try again later
   - Use the Direct Play tab as an alternative

4. **GUI doesn't start**:
   - Make sure the virtual environment is activated
   - Run `pip install customtkinter requests` if needed

5. **No video plays**:
   - Make sure you have a compatible video player installed (mpv, VLC, etc.)
   - Check if the anime name is spelled correctly
   - Try using different title variations from search results
